## dopewars-el

Dopewars is a classic game where you play a drug dealer in 1985 New York
City, and you have one month to make as much money as possible. It's in
essence a buy-low-sell-high economics game. I liked
playing [the original game](https://dopewars.sourceforge.io/) so much that I
decided to write it in emacs lisp... because if there's one thing I know for
sure, it's that not enough people write stupid little programs for emacs.

I'm basing this clone/implementation on both gameplay experience of the
original, and also on a bit of the C source code for things I have trouble
figuring out.

### A Note on Usability

This game is *not* actually ready for any sort of proper use; in fact, all
I've managed to do so far is some very fundamental buy/sell/jet
functionality. While it ain't nothin', it sure ain't a full game. I'll be
adding features regularly (and probably rewriting large swaths of the
codebase) until it's something that actually makes sense. Please forgive the
utter grossness of most of the functions.

I've only written a few projects in emacs-lisp, and I'm still very much
learning how to use it, so I will stress this: I am using this project as a
way to get better at elisp, and using it to learn how to write and properly
package an elisp program.

That being said, here are some features that I still have yet to implement:

* Bronx / Ghetto activities
  * ~~Loan shark!~~ *done!*
  * Bank!
* ~~'Drop' action~~ *done!*
* Subway encounters (An old woman on the subway says...)
* Endgame procedure
* High scores
* Cops
* "Bitches"
* Guns
* Expensive/cheap notifications and functionality
* Most other things

### Thanks

A big thanks to the folks in Freenode's #emacs channel for being awesome.
They're almost as friendly as that huge spider in my garage that keeps
offering hugs.
